# PROJECT: Pathfinder
# DESCRIPTION: Vala / elementary OS / macOS Hybrid Environment
# =================================================================

# --- 1. Vala Transpilation Artifacts ---
# Vala is a "transpiled" language that converts to C. We ignore 
# these because they are machine-generated and redundant. 
# Including them would bloat your git history and misidentify 
# the project language as C on GitHub.
*.c
*.h
*.vapi
!src/manual_config.h  # Example: Only keep C files you hand-wrote

# --- 2. Meson & Ninja Build Directories ---
# In elementary OS, we use "out-of-source" builds. All the heavy
# lifting happens in these folders. We never push these to GitHub 
# because they are specific to your Mac mini's architecture.

# --- 3. Binaries & Executables ---
# These are the final "Pathfinder" app files. They are large 
# and shouldn't be version controlled.

# --- 4. elementary OS & AppCenter (Flatpak) ---
# When you test your app for the AppCenter, Flatpak creates
# these folders to manage the sandbox environment.
.flatpak-builder/
repo/
/.flatpak/

# --- 5. macOS System Junk ---
# Since you are working on a Mac mini, macOS creates hidden 
# metadata files like .DS_Store. If you don't ignore these, 
# they will clutter your GitHub and look messy to Linux users.
.DS_Store
.AppleDouble
.LSOverride
._*
.Spotlight-V100
.Trashes

# --- 6. Editor & IDE Settings ---
# These folders store your personal window positions and 
# local project settings for VS Code or GNOME Builder.
